## Answer 1.

Use orders;

/*Explanation of the code:
1)This query first concatenates the title (Mr or Ms) with the first name and last name of the customer in upper case using the CONCAT function and assigns the result to a column full_name.
2)Next, it uses the CASE statement to determine the category based on the customer's creation date, as specified by the conditions you provided. 
3)The YEAR function is used to extract the year component of the creation_date field.

## Answer 2.

Use orders;

SELECT PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID FROM PRODUCT,ORDER_ITEMS;
SELECT PRODUCT_DESC, PRODUCT_QUANTITY_AVAIL,PRODUCT_PRICE, (PRODUCT_QUANTITY_AVAIL * PRODUCT_PRICE) AS Inventory_Value,

FROM  PRODUCT AS P
LEFT JOIN ORDER_ITEMS  AS OI 
    ON OI.PRODUCT_ID = P.PRODUCT_ID 
WHERE OI.PRODUCT_ID IS NULL

ORDER BY Inventory_Value DESC;

/*Explanation of the code:
1)SELECT statement: The first line of the code selects the PRODUCT_ID column from the PRODUCT table.
2)Then in the next step selects several columns from the PRODUCT table. The columns are PRODUCT_DESC, PRODUCT_QUANTITY_AVAIL, PRODUCT_PRICE, and an expression that calculates the Inventory_Value (product quantity available multiplied by product price). The code also includes a CASE statement that calculates a New_Price based on discounts applied to the product price.
3)FROM clause: The FROM clause specifies the PRODUCT table with an alias P, and performs a LEFT JOIN with the ORDER_ITEMS table with an alias OI. The LEFT JOIN will return all rows from the PRODUCT table and the matching rows from the ORDER_ITEMS table. If there's no match, the result will contain NULL values for the columns from the ORDER_ITEMS table.
4)WHERE clause and ORDER BY clause: The WHERE clause filters the results to only include rows where the PRODUCT_ID in the ORDER_ITEMS table is NULL. The ORDER BY clause sorts the results in descending order based on the Inventory_Value.

  PRODUCT_CLASS.PRODUCT_CLASS_CODE, 
  PRODUCT_CLASS.PRODUCT_CLASS_DESC 
HAVING 
  INVENTORY_VALUE > 100000 
ORDER BY 
  INVENTORY_VALUE DESC;

/*Explanation of the code:
1)Joining the tables: The code performs an inner join between the "PRODUCT" and "PRODUCT_CLASS" tables on the "PRODUCT_CLASS_CODE" column. This returns only the rows where there is a match between the two tables.
2)Aggregating data: The code then groups the result of the join by "PRODUCT_CLASS_CODE" and "PRODUCT_CLASS_DESC" and calculates the count of products (PRODUCT_COUNT) and the sum of the product quantity available multiplied by the price (INVENTORY_VALUE) for each product class.
3)Filtering and sorting: The code filters the result using the HAVING clause to only show product classes where the INVENTORY_VALUE is greater than 100000. The result is finally sorted in descending order based on the INVENTORY_VALUE.

JOIN ADDRESS ON ONLINE_CUSTOMER.ADDRESS_ID = ADDRESS.ADDRESS_ID
WHERE
SHIPPER.SHIPPER_NAME = 'DHL'
GROUP BY
SHIPPER.SHIPPER_NAME,

/*Explanation of the code:
1)Joining the tables: The query starts by joining the SHIPPER table with the ORDER_HEADER table on the SHIPPER_ID column. Then, it joins the ONLINE_CUSTOMER table with the ORDER_HEADER table on the CUSTOMER_ID column. Finally, it joins the ADDRESS table with the ONLINE_CUSTOMER table on the ADDRESS_ID column.
2)Filtering the data: The query filters the data to include only the shipper with the name 'DHL' by using a WHERE clause.
3)Grouping and aggregating the data: The query groups the data by SHIPPER_NAME and CITY and counts the number of distinct CUSTOMER_ID values as NUM_OF_CUSTOMERS and counts the number of SHIPPER_ID values as NUM_OF_CONSIGNMENTS. The final result displays the shipper name, city, number of customers, and number of consignments.

1)Joining of tables: The "PRODUCT", "PRODUCT_CLASS", and "ORDER_ITEMS" tables are joined on common columns. This allows the data from these tables to be combined and used in the same query.
2)Grouping of data: The query uses the "GROUP BY" clause to group the data by product ID, description, quantity available, and product class description. This allows the calculation of aggregate values such as the sum of product quantities sold.
3)Calculating Inventory Status: The query uses a "CASE" statement to calculate the inventory status based on the values of product quantity available and the sum of product quantities sold. The inventory status is calculated differently based on the product class description, with three possible values: "No Sales in past, give discount to reduce inventory", "Low inventory, need to add inventory", "Medium inventory, need to add some inventory", and "Sufficient inventory". The calculated inventory status is assigned to the "INVENTORY_STATUS" column in the result set.
4)Finally, the query selects the product ID, description, quantity available, quantity sold, and inventory status columns from the result set.

    FROM CARTON
    WHERE CARTON_ID = 10
  )
)
GROUP BY oi.ORDER_ID
ORDER BY total_volume DESC
limit 1;

/*Explanation of the code:
1)First, the query joins the ORDER_ITEMS table and PRODUCT table based on the PRODUCT_ID.
2)The query then filters the results based on the order_id of the ORDER_ITEMS table. The filtered order_ids are the ones that do not belong to an order that has a total volume greater than the carton id 10. This is done by using a subquery to calculate the total volume for each order and then excluding the orders whose volume exceeds the carton id 10.
3)Finally, the query groups the results by order_id, sums up the total volume of the products, and orders the results in descending order based on the total volume. It then returns only the first result, which is the order with the biggest volume that can fit in the carton id 10.

limit 6;

/*Explanation of the code:
1)Joining Tables: The query starts by joining multiple tables such as ORDER_ITEMS, PRODUCT, ORDER_HEADER, ONLINE_CUSTOMER, and ADDRESS using JOIN clauses.
2)Filtering Data: After joining tables, a WHERE clause is used to filter the data. The data is filtered based on the conditions - only those products are selected whose product_id is not 201 and those are only sold with product_id 201, and which are not shipped to Bangalore and New Delhi cities.
3)Grouping and Sorting Data: The query uses a GROUP BY clause to group the data based on product_id and product_desc, and then uses SUM function to calculate the total quantity of each product. Finally, the data is sorted in descending order of tot_qty.

## Answer 10.

AND a.PINCODE NOT LIKE '5%'
GROUP BY oh.ORDER_ID, oh.CUSTOMER_ID, FULL_NAME 
ORDER BY oh.ORDER_ID desc
limit 15;

/*Explanation of the code:
1)Retrieval of information from multiple tables: The query retrieves information from the ORDER_HEADER, ONLINE_CUSTOMER, ORDER_ITEMS, and ADDRESS tables. The JOIN clause is used to link the data from these tables based on the common columns: oh.CUSTOMER_ID = oc.CUSTOMER_ID, oh.ORDER_ID = oi.ORDER_ID and oc.ADDRESS_ID = a.ADDRESS_ID.
2)Filtering the result set: The WHERE clause specifies the conditions to filter the result set. The query selects only the orders where the order ID is even (oh.ORDER_ID % 2 = 0) and the pincode in the address table does not start with 5 (a.PINCODE NOT LIKE '5%').
3)Modifying and aggregating the result set: The query uses the concat function to concatenate the customer's first name and last name and assign it to the FULL_NAME column. The SUM function is used to calculate the total product quantity per order, and the GROUP BY clause groups the result by the order ID, customer ID, and full name. Finally, the ORDER BY clause sorts the result set by the order ID in descending order, and the LIMIT clause restricts the result set to 15 rows.
